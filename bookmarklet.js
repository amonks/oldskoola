// js library for making websites look like old documents
// andrew monks 2014

// currently you need 2 bookmarklets cuz we can't run the thing until the image library loads and all the things I've tried to fix that don't work

// 1. load:
javascript:var a=document.createElement("script");a.setAttribute("src","https://raw2.github.com/amonks/oldskoola/master/oldskoola.js");document.body.appendChild(a);

// 2. run:
javascript:oldskoola();
